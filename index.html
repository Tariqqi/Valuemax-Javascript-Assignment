      <h2>History of JavaScript</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that was
        created to make web pages interactive. It was developed by Brendan Eich
        while working at Netscape Communications Corporation and first appeared
        in December 1995. The language has since evolved significantly and is
        now one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML
        and CSS.
      </p>

      <h3>Early Beginnings</h3>
      <div class="highlight">
        <p>
          <strong>Netscape and Mocha:</strong> JavaScript was initially called
          Mocha, later renamed to LiveScript, and finally JavaScript to
          capitalize on the popularity of Java at the time. Netscape Navigator
          2.0 included the first version of the language.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>ECMAScript:</strong> In 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to
          ECMA International for standardization, resulting in the ECMAScript
          specification, officially known as ECMA-262. The first edition was
          published in 1997.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>Evolution and Standardization</h3>
      <div class="highlight">
        <p>
          <strong>Versions of ECMAScript:</strong> Over the years, ECMAScript
          has undergone numerous revisions. Some of the most significant updates
          include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>ECMAScript 3 (1999):</strong> Introduced regular
            expressions, better string handling, and exception handling.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>ECMAScript 5 (2009):</strong> Added features like strict
            mode, JSON support, and array methods.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>ECMAScript 6 (2015):</strong> Also known as ES6 or ES2015,
            this version introduced major changes such as arrow functions,
            classes, template literals, <code>let</code> and
            <code>const</code> keywords, and modules.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Subsequent Versions:</strong> Annual updates have continued
            to add new features and improvements.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3>Modern JavaScript</h3>
      <div class="highlight">
        <p>
          <strong>Node.js:</strong> In 2009, Ryan Dahl introduced Node.js,
          allowing JavaScript to be used for server-side scripting. This
          expanded the language's capabilities beyond the browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Frameworks and Libraries:</strong> JavaScript has a rich
          ecosystem of frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue.js,
          which help developers build complex web applications efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Community and Usage:</strong> JavaScript is one of the most
          popular programming languages in the world, used by millions of
          developers and supported by a vast community.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Let, Var, and Const in JavaScript</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript provides three ways to declare variables: <code>var</code>,
        <code>let</code>, and <code>const</code>. Understanding the differences
        between them is crucial for writing effective and bug-free code.
      </p>

      <h3>var</h3>
      <div class="highlight">
        <p>
          <strong>Function Scope:</strong> Variables declared with
          <code>var</code> are function-scoped, meaning they are accessible
          within the function they are declared in, or globally if declared
          outside any function.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Hoisting:</strong> <code>var</code> declarations are hoisted
          to the top of their scope, meaning the declaration is processed before
          any code is executed. However, initialization is not hoisted.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Re-declaration:</strong> You can re-declare variables using
          <code>var</code> within the same scope without errors.
        </p>
        <pre><code>function exampleVar() {
  console.log(a); // undefined due to hoisting
  var a = 10;
  console.log(a); // 10
}
exampleVar();
console.log(a); // ReferenceError: a is not defined</code></pre>
      </div>

      <h3>let</h3>
      <div class="highlight">
        <p>
          <strong>Block Scope:</strong> Variables declared with
          <code>let</code> are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible
          within the block, statement, or expression they are declared in.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Hoisting:</strong> <code>let</code> declarations are also
          hoisted, but unlike <code>var</code>, they are not initialized until
          the declaration is encountered. This leads to a "temporal dead zone"
          where the variable cannot be accessed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>No Re-declaration:</strong> Re-declaring a
          <code>let</code> variable in the same scope results in a syntax error.
        </p>
        <pre><code>function exampleLet() {
  console.log(b); // ReferenceError: b is not defined
  let b = 20;
  console.log(b); // 20
  {
    let b = 30;
    console.log(b); // 30 (block-scoped)
  }
  console.log(b); // 20
}
exampleLet();</code></pre>
      </div>

      <h3>const</h3>
      <div class="highlight">
        <p>
          <strong>Block Scope:</strong> Like <code>let</code>,
          <code>const</code> is block-scoped.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Hoisting:</strong> <code>const</code> declarations are hoisted
          but are not initialized, similar to <code>let</code>. Accessing the
          variable before its declaration results in a ReferenceError.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Immutability:</strong> <code>const</code> variables cannot be
          reassigned after their initial assignment. However, this does not mean
          the value is immutable. For objects and arrays, the contents can still
          be modified.
        </p>
        <pre><code>function exampleConst() {
  const c = 30;
  console.log(c); // 30
  // c = 40; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

  const arr = [1, 2, 3];
  arr.push(4); // Allowed
  console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 3, 4]

  const obj = { key: 'value' };
  obj.key = 'newValue'; // Allowed
  console.log(obj); // { key: 'newValue' }
}
exampleConst();</code></pre>
      </div>

      <h3>Best Practices</h3>
      <div class="highlight">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong
              >Use <code>let</code> for variables that will be
              reassigned.</strong
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >Use <code>const</code> for variables that should not be
              reassigned.</strong
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >Avoid using <code>var</code> to prevent issues related to
              hoisting and scope.</strong
            >
          </li>
        </ul>
