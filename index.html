      <h2>History of JavaScript</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language created to make web pages interactive. Developed by Brendan Eich while at Netscape Communications Corporation, it first appeared in December 1995. JavaScript has since evolved and is now one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.
      </p>

      <h3>JavaScript History</h3>
      <p>
        The first version of JavaScript was ECMAScript 1 (ES1), released in 1997. This was followed by ECMAScript 2 (ES2) in 1998 and ECMAScript 3 (ES3) in 1999. ES3 introduced new features like regular expressions, try/catch blocks, and new statements.
      </p>

      <h3>JavaScript / ECMAScript</h3>
      <p>
        JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan Eich in 1995 for Netscape 2 and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997. The Mozilla Foundation continued its development for Firefox, with its version matching ES5. Internet Explorer 4 was the first browser to support ECMAScript Edition 1 (ES1).
      </p>

      <h3>The ECMA Technical Committee 39</h3>
      <p>
        In 1996, Netscape and Brendan Eich presented JavaScript to the ECMA international standards organization. A technical committee (TC39) was established to oversee the language's development. ECMA-262 Edition 1 was released in June 1997.
      </p>

      <h3>From ES4 to ES6</h3>
      <p>
        In 2008, the TC39 committee faced a split between two camps:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The ECMAScript 3.1 Camp: Microsoft and Yahoo advocated for an incremental upgrade from ES3.</li>
        <li>The ECMAScript 4 Camp: Adobe, Mozilla, Opera, and Google pushed for a substantial overhaul with ES4.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        On August 13, 2008, Brendan Eich announced that the standards body was divided. The compromise was to rename ES4 to ES5 and focus on a new major release. ES5, released in 2009, was widely adopted by browsers by July 2013.

      <p>
        ECMAScript 6 (ES6), released in 2015, was also a major success. Full support was achieved in all major browsers by March 2017.
